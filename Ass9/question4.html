            <h1>Responsive Typography with clamp()</h1>
            <p>
                Responsive typography is a crucial aspect of modern web design. By using CSS functions 
                like clamp(), we can create fluid typography that scales smoothly across different screen 
                sizes without the need for multiple media queries. The clamp() function takes three parameters: 
                a minimum value, a preferred value (usually based on viewport width), and a maximum value.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach ensures that text remains readable on small mobile screens while taking advantage 
                of the extra space available on larger desktop displays. The font size automatically adjusts 
                based on the viewport width, providing an optimal reading experience for users across all devices. 
                This technique eliminates the need for managing numerous breakpoints for typography alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond just font sizing, responsive typography also considers line-height, letter-spacing, and 
                margins to create a harmonious and readable layout. When implemented correctly, responsive 
                typography enhances user engagement and improves the overall accessibility of your website.
