My Journey into the World of Web Development 

Hey there! I’m Sparsh — and this journal is where I’m tracking my progress as I learn web development from the ground up.I am mentored by Sahil Sir and Deepak Sir from Bridzlab. It’s my way of documenting what I explore, build, and figure out along the way — from HTML basics to CSS styling, then onward to JavaScript and beyond. Let’s dive in

Day 1: The Foundation — HTML & Web Concepts
Date: 09/10/2025

* What I Explored
The Web’s Structure: Understood the classic 3-tier architecture — frontend, backend, and database — and how they interact.

HTML Basics: Played around with essential tags like headings, paragraphs, tables, and images.

My Setup: Installed VS Code and started using the Live Server extension to instantly preview changes.

How It All Connects: Learned how localhost, IP addresses, and ports work behind the scenes when a page loads in the browser.

> Task
Created a simple class timetable using HTML’s <table> tag and tested it live through VS Code’s server.

> Next Goal
Dig deeper into HTML structure — exploring block vs. inline elements, lists, and attributes.

Day 2: Structuring Content & Building Forms
Date: 10/10/2025

* What I Explored
Block vs Inline: Finally made sense of the difference between the two.

HTML Layouts: Used the <div> tag to organize content neatly.

Lists & Attributes: Got comfortable with attributes and created ordered and unordered lists.

Forms: Designed my first form with text, email, and password fields — along with radio buttons and checkboxes.

> Task
Built a user registration form that collects basic info from users.

> Next Goal
Time to make things look beautiful — next up, CSS!

Day 3: Getting Hands-On with CSS & The Box Model
Date: 13/10/2025

* What I Explored
How to Apply CSS: Tried out inline, internal, and external styling methods.

Selectors & Properties: Learned to target specific elements and style them.

The Box Model: Understood how padding, margin, border, and content define an element’s space.

Display & Position: Played with block, inline, and positioning techniques like relative, absolute, and fixed.

> Task
Styled a small webpage using an external CSS file, experimenting with spacing, background colors, and layout alignment.

> Next Goal
Learn Flexbox and CSS Grid — the modern layout superpowers.

Day 4: Layouts, Flexbox & Visual Touches
Date: 30/10/2025

* What I Explored
Flexbox & Grid: Practiced building responsive layouts that automatically adjust.

Visual Flair: Added gradients, shadows, and simple hover effects to give designs some life.

Advanced Selectors: Discovered combinators and pseudo-classes for fine-tuned styling.

Box Model Practice: Reinforced sizing and spacing skills.

> Task
Designed a calculator interface using CSS Grid. Gave it a modern gradient background and button shadows.

> Next Goal
Step into responsive design — learn media queries and motion effects.

Day 5: CSS Interactivity & Animations
Date: 31/10/2025

* What I Explored
Pseudo-classes: Learned how to style elements dynamically with :hover, :focus, and :active.

Transitions vs Animations: Understood when to use each for smooth effects.

Transformations: Used translate(), rotate(), and scale() for motion.

Tooltips & Box Sizing: Built a small tooltip using only CSS and finally understood box-sizing: border-box.

> Task
Created a diagonal hover animation combining transform and transition. It felt satisfying to see smooth motion come alive!

> Next Goal
Master responsive design with media queries and CSS filters.

Day 6: Jumping into Bootstrap
Date: 03/11/2025

* What I Explored
Bootstrap Basics: Learned how this framework speeds up layout creation.

Responsive Grid System: Understood the 12-column layout model.

Prebuilt Components: Tried out buttons, cards, and navbars.

Utility Classes: Discovered how simple class names can quickly adjust spacing and alignment.

> Task
Built a responsive portfolio page using Bootstrap — it scaled perfectly across devices!

> Next Goal
Review CSS and dive deeper into advanced Bootstrap components like carousels and modals.

Day 7: Advanced Bootstrap & CSS Recap
Date: 04/11/2025

* What I Explored
CSS Refresher: Revisited Flexbox, Grid, and responsive techniques.

Bootstrap Carousel: Implemented a sliding project showcase.

Interactive Components: Added modals and progress bars to improve user interaction.

Utility Classes: Continued using them for quick, clean styling tweaks.

> Task
Enhanced my portfolio site by integrating a Bootstrap carousel and a Contact Me modal.

> Next Goal
Time to bring logic into the mix — learning JavaScript next!

Day 8: My First Steps with JavaScript
Date: 05/11/2025

* What I Explored
What JS Does: Understood JavaScript as the “behavior” part of a webpage.

How to Link It: Learned to connect .js files with HTML.

Core Concepts: Got familiar with variables (var, let, const), basic data types, and using console.log() for debugging.

First Script: Wrote a script that runs on page load and responds to a button click.

> Task
Created a simple page with a button — the script logs a message when the page loads and another when the button is clicked.

> Next Goal
Deepen my JS knowledge — focusing on operators, conditionals, and writing reusable functions.
