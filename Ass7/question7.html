            <h2>The Art of Typography in Web Design</h2>
            
            <p class="intro">
                Typography is one of the most fundamental aspects of web design. It plays a crucial role in how users perceive and interact with content. Good typography enhances readability, establishes hierarchy, and creates an emotional connection with the reader.

                Different font families convey different emotions and serve different purposes. Serif fonts, like Times New Roman, are often used for traditional and formal content. Sans-serif fonts, like Arial, provide a clean and modern look that works well for digital interfaces.

                Font weight is another important consideration. <strong>Bold text</strong> draws attention and emphasizes important information. <em>Italic text</em> can indicate emphasis, quotes, or foreign words. Combined with proper <mark>highlighting techniques</mark>, typography can guide the reader's eye through the content effectively.

                Line height and letter spacing are subtle but powerful tools. Proper line height ensures comfortable reading, preventing text from feeling cramped. Letter spacing can improve readability, especially for headings and uppercase text. These adjustments make text more accessible and enjoyable to read.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Text alignment also affects readability. Left-aligned text is standard for most languages and feels natural. Center alignment works well for headings and short quotes. Right alignment can create visual interest but should be used sparingly in body text.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In conclusion, mastering typography is essential for creating effective web designs. By carefully choosing font families, weights, sizes, spacing, and alignment, designers can create content that is both beautiful and functional.
